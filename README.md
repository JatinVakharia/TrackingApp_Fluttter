# flutter-line-up-tracker
Flutter app to track interview line ups for client fit

# Stages to be tracked
Define owner for each, allow reminder notification for each stage and keep it all configurable as more stages can be added later.

`Globant interview select -> request resumes in expected formats -> start technical revision -> request schedule for client fit -> inform candidate about the schedule -> request client fit feedback -> confirm candidate joining date for external candidate -> process background check -> process onboarding -> confirm onboarding finished.`
